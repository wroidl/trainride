                    Only when a great tune comes together with great lyrics, a song can unfold its entire
                    power. If you donâ€™t understand the lyrics, you might like the melody, but it takes much more to
                    really carry you away. <br> <br>

                    Since German is not a wide-spread language, most people are oblivious to German music. And even
                    those people, who have learned to speak decent German, will have difficulties to
                    understand and appreciate the more intricate lyrics, since the language is often playfully modified
                    and many songs are packed with cultural references, that are incomprehensible for non-native
                    speakers. <br> <br>

                    On train ride to berlin, I want to share my passion for German singer/songwriter music. Iâ€™m
                    going to present songs and artists and I will  translate the lyrics and explain
                    things that go beyond the Google translater experience. Follow this blog if you are
                    interested in German music and pop culture. <br> <br> <br>


                    <!-- <em>But you should note that:</em> <br> <br></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Iâ€™m not a critic. I just present songs that I like. Iâ€™m not judging the music, because every
                            song I feature here is a great song from a great artist.</li> <br>
                        <li> Iâ€™m not a native English speaker. I canâ€™t give you poetic translations in the sense of beeing
                            poetic in English myself. I will rather offer pretty raw translations and then explain the
                            meaning of specific German words and phrases. Please excuse my mistakes and feel free to give a
                            hint, if you find one.</li> <br>
                        <li> Iâ€™m always happy to get suggestions, but I wonâ€™t write about songs that I donâ€™t like. Feel free
                            to share your ideas with me, but you wonâ€™t find Rammstein lyrics on my blog ðŸ˜‰</li>
