                    Only when a great tune comes together with great lyrics, a song can unfold its entire
                    energy. If you donâ€™t understand the lyrics, you might like the melody, but it takes much more to
                    blow your mind. <br> <br>

                    Since German is not a wide-spread language, most people are oblivious to German music. And even
                    those people, who have learned to speak decent German, will very likely have difficulties to
                    understand and appreciate the more intricate lyrics, since the language is often playfully modified
                    and many songs are packed with cultural references, that are incomprehensible for non-native
                    speakers. <br> <br>

                    On train ride to berlin, I want to share my passion for German singer/songwriter music with you. Iâ€™m
                    going to present my favorite songs and artists and I will carefully translate the lyrics and explain
                    everything that goes beyond the Google translater experience. Follow this blog if you are
                    interested in German music and pop culture. And if you are learning German anyway, this might also
                    be a good way to complement your lessons. <br> <br> <br>


                <em>But you sould note that:</em> <br> <br></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Iâ€™m not a critic. I just present songs that I like. Iâ€™m not judging the music, because every
                        song I feature here is a great song from a great artist.</li> <br>
                    <li> Iâ€™m not a native English speaker. I canâ€™t give you poetic translations in the sense of beeing
                        poetic in English myself. I will rather offer pretty raw translations and then explain the
                        meaning of specific German words and phrases. Please excuse my mistakes and feel free to give a
                        hint, if you find one.</li> <br>
                    <li> Iâ€™m always happy to get suggestions, but I wonâ€™t write about songs that I donâ€™t like. Feel free
                        to share your ideas with me, but you wonâ€™t find Rammstein lyrics on my blog ðŸ˜‰</li>
